# History
The colors of `sunburst-theme.el` are derived from a `color-theme.el` theme
created by someone identifying themselves as 'dngpng'.  References
to it can be found [here](http://pdeng.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/my-emacs-color-theme/).

Since I didn't originally create this color-theme, I assert no copyright about the code
that I add to it.
